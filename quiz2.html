    <h5>Trees</h5>
    <body>
        <p>I think that I shall never see<br>
        A poem lovely as a tree.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
        Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
        And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
        </p>
        <p>
        A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
        A nest of robins in her hair;
        </p>
        <p>
        Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
        Who intimately lives with rain.
        </p>
        <p>
        Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
        But only God can make a tree.
